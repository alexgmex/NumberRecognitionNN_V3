GUI-Enabled Neural Network from scratch for the MNIST database using Numpy, Pandas, Pygame and Matplotlib, which trains and then tests itself on recognising handwritten numbers.

After much refactoring, debugging, and research, his is the 3rd iteration I've made of this neural-network style project, with my highest accuracy yet of 91-92%!

Through my own research and code I've learned heaps about AI and machine learning along the way that I never thought possible, and I'd love to return and refine this project as I continue to learn and grow in this field!

To run, simply run NumberRecognitionNN_V3.py

To speed up the code, consider altering the layer densities (line 209) or commenting out the GUI functionality (line 138-148).

Requirements:
*pip install pandas numpy pygame matplotlib*
